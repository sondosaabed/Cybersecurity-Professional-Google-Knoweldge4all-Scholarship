## Sondos As a Digital Gurdian
At the end of this Certificate I have build teh follwoing portfolio:

Two of my strengths that I have a remarkable ability to learn new technologies and upskill, I also have strong written and verbal communication. As for my values, I strongly believe in protecting user’s privacy and data. My main mantra is “People before profit”. My interest in cybersecurity stems from research that I have done on the use of social media, where public data were misused in elections. I want to be able to protect others, and companies, and be aware of such issues. I believe that my values, strengths, and interest in cybersecurity have made me fit with the security goals of various organizations.
